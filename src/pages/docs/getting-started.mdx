## What is Timekeeper

Timekeeper is an automated tracing solution which injects logging statements into your code.

The full process revolves around using a plugin for a popular build tool to detect your function invokations and decorating them with a specially crafted function 
which handles the logging. The generated logs include:

* The function name <br />
* Time taken to execute the  <br />
* Correlation ID (if applicable) <br />
